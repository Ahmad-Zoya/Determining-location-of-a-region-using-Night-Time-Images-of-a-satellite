# Determining-location-of-a-region-using-Night-Time-Images-of-a-satellite

## Overview

Tool designed to process and analyze nighttime satellite images, identifying lighted areas and estimating their corresponding geographical locations. It utilizes image processing techniques, reverse geocoding, and contour analysis to provide insights into the distribution of light sources and their spatial characteristics.

## Key Features

- Processing of nighttime satellite images
- Automated contour analysis for identifying lighted areas
- Reverse geocoding to determine the geographical locations of the identified areas
- Visualization of the lighted areas on the original satellite image
- Estimation of the total lighted area in square kilometers

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Geopy
- Geocoder

## How to Use

1. Install the required dependencies using the provided installation commands.
2. Prepare your nighttime satellite image.
3. Run the script, providing the path to your image.
4. Obtain the visualized image with marked lighted areas and corresponding geographical information.

## Results

The Nighttime Lights Analyzer enables the identification and analysis of lighted areas in satellite images, providing crucial insights into the spatial distribution of artificial lighting. With its simple yet effective functionalities, it serves as a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers interested in urban development, energy consumption, and environmental monitoring.
